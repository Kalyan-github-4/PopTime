# PopTime ⏰
A sleek and animated digital clock featuring a unique scrolling digit display. PopTime displays the current time using six vertical columns, each smoothly scrolling upward, with the active digit highlighted by an engaging popping bubble animation.

## ✨ Features
- **Animated Digit Scrolling**: Each digit column smoothly scrolls upward as time changes

## 🎨 Design
The clock features six vertical sticks arranged to show time in HH:MM:SS format:
- **Hours**: Two columns (10s and 1s place)
- **Minutes**: Two columns (10s and 1s place)
- **Seconds**: Two columns (10s and 1s place)

Each column displays digits 0-9 in a scrolling fashion, with the current time digit highlighted in a distinctive bubble with a popping animation effect.

## 🚀 Demo
The clock automatically updates every second, creating a mesmerizing effect as the digits scroll and pop into focus. The seconds columns update most frequently, while hours change less often, creating a dynamic visual rhythm.
